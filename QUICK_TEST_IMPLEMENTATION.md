# âš¡ **2-Hour Test Implementation - Maximum Impact**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Goal: 30% â†’ 70% Coverage in 2 Hours**

### Hour 1: Critical Hook Tests (Highest Coverage Impact)

#### A. Financial Data Hook Test (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create: src/hooks/__tests__/useFinanceData.test.ts
# Test: CRUD operations, state management, error handling
# Impact: +20% coverage
```

#### B. Dashboard Config Hook Test (30 minutes)  
```bash
# Create: src/hooks/__tests__/useDashboardConfig.test.ts
# Test: Card management, persistence, fallbacks
# Impact: +15% coverage
```

### Hour 2: Core Component Tests

#### C. Dashboard Component Test (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create: src/components/__tests__/Dashboard.test.tsx
# Test: Card rendering, interactions, time filters
# Impact: +15% coverage
```

#### D. Layout Component Test (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create: src/components/__tests__/Layout.test.tsx  
# Test: Navigation, responsive behavior, tab switching
# Impact: +10% coverage
```

## ðŸš€ **After 2 Hours: Run Full Test Suite**

```bash
npm run test:coverage          # Should show ~70% coverage
npm run test:e2e              # Verify E2E tests pass
npm run dev                   # Test the application
```

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results**
- **Coverage: 70%+** (from current ~30%)
- **Critical Paths: 100% tested** (Auth, CRUD, Dashboard)
- **Confidence: High** for production deployment
